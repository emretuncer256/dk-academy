# DK Academy (Dream Library Academy)

DK Academy is an innovative educational tool designed to make learning fun and engaging for elementary students. By generating personalized comic books based on each student's interests and the topics they are studying, this platform transforms traditional learning into an interactive, visually rich experience. Subjects like mathematics come to life through storytelling, making them more relatable and enjoyable for young learners.

## Key Features

- **Personalized Comic Generation**: Tailors each comic book to the student's age, interests, and learning topic, providing a customized educational experience.
- **Interactive Learning**: Every comic panel includes a story, visuals, and a question, encouraging students to actively participate in their own learning.
- **Visual Content**: Leverages the **SDXL Lightning model** to generate high-quality images for the comic panels, enriching the visual experience.
- **Text Generation**: Uses **Google's Gemini model** to create personalized stories, questions, and explanations, ensuring the content is relevant to the student's learning journey.
- **User-Friendly Web Interface**: Built with **Streamlit**, offering a simple and intuitive way for users to input student data and view the generated comic.

## How It Works

1. The studentâ€™s information is entered, including their name, age, gender, interests, and the learning topic.
2. The AI generates a JSON structure containing the personalized comic book.
3. Each comic consists of multiple panels, with two visuals per panel, a story, and interactive questions that relate to the learning topic.
4. The student engages with the subject by following the story and answering questions embedded within the narrative.

## Technologies Used

- **Google Gemini Model**: Powers the generation of personalized stories, questions, and educational content.
- **SDXL Lightning Model**: Used to quickly generate high-quality images for each comic panel.
- **Streamlit**: Provides a clean and user-friendly web interface for generating and viewing the personalized comics.
